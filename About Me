I am a free app developer. I enjoy developing iOS apps related to graphics. My buddies include photographers from the studio and professional post production artists. We really enjoy transforming some commercial image editing functions into app features.

We have many developed software:
NC PRO: Professional photography software that can replace native cameras
MINI RETRO: A nostalgic vintage film machine
PIXEL MOTION: A professional post editing software
